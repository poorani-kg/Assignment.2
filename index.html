    <p>Music is therapy to relax our mind. It helps us travel and makes us happy. I have visited many concerts in my life. But here I would like to talk about one concert I recently attended two weeks ago. It was all about Arjit Singh. Arjit Singh is a well-renowned singer in our country. Moreover, he has sung more than a hundred songs in the Bollywood industry. He has been singing since he was six years old. His voice is melodious, and he performs well on stage. Moreover, in the concert, there were more than 10,000 people, and the ticket price was just Rs 50. It was really a remarkable place for enjoyment. My friend and I visited that place, and I was working there as a volunteer. I had the chance to stand in front of the stage. Although I was working there as a volunteer, I got to listen to his music, and his voice is melodious. He made my day. I went with my girlfriend another day because it was a two-day concert. My girlfriend is fond of singing, and she loves to hear Arjit Singh's songs. Arjit Singh is also a very famous actor. At the concert, we had the chance to enjoy a delightful dinner as well. There were more than 600 people working as volunteers because everyone loves Arjit Singh. The concert was fully lit, and the stage was beautifully decorated. There were musical drummers as well, who played a vital role in that concert. I would say everyone should visit that concert. Next month, we have another concert for Arjit Singh, and I'm really excited that I already purchased my ticket. My friend gave me that concert ticket, so I will definitely attend that concert to relax. I would suggest everyone that this concert is really amazing because it was filled with people, and I like being in a crowd. Everyone was singing at that time. This is the concert I enjoyed.</p>
